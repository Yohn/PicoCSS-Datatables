# Work in Progress

Still has some cleaning up to do, but usable datatables.
## Features
 - loading from URL
 - loading from json array
 - pagenation
 - column sorting
 - column toggling: show or hide column
 - searching
 - editing rows

## TODO:
 - I think splitting the thead, tbody, tfoot, and pagination functions to their own functions would be better than having them all in the render function.
 - Remove all id's so we're not constrained to using them
 - use svg for sorting icons
 - formatting with editing columns
 - option to use modal for editing column
 - more testing
 - switch to use pico dropdowns for column toggling
 - when editing a date / time column use browser datetime input type
 - When row is edited we cant edit that row again - becasue event listeners arent attached anymore
